# Yet Another Cryptopals Repository (YACR)

This repository contains solutions to [the cryptopals' crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) in C# (as modern as I can make it at the time of writing).
Not sure if I'll actually complete the entire series, but let's have a go.

It should obviously go unstated that you should not be using any of this code anywhere in production as I'm a bumbling buffoon with very little knowledge of actual cryptography.
If you use this code, anything that happens is on *you* for trusting some internet rando.
Don't do that, as that makes sad pandas even sadder.
